# Respiro AI – Embedded Hardware Module

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a low-cost embedded respiratory monitoring system. The goal is to develop a hardware module capable of sensing breathing patterns and enabling future integration with AI-based analysis systems.

## Problem Statement
While AI models can analyze respiratory data effectively, many systems lack affordable and portable hardware modules for real-time breath acquisition. This project aims to bridge that gap.

## Objective
- Design a breath sensing hardware architecture
- Select appropriate sensors and microcontroller
- Implement signal acquisition and processing
- Enable future AI integration
